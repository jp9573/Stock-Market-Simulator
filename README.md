# Stock Market Simulator
It is a basic simulation website for stock market, which gives real time experience for its user, initially $100000 virtual currency is given when user registered. 

It is based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP. For stock market live data I've used Yahoo Financial API that will gives the data in JSON format by generating REST URL.

Nice implementation for learns
